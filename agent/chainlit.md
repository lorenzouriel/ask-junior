# Welcome to Ask Junior!

Your AI-powered knowledge base assistant for querying internal documentation.

## How to Use

Simply type your question in natural language and Ask Junior will search through the knowledge base to find relevant information and provide a concise answer.

### Features

- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant content even if you don't use exact keywords
- **Source Attribution**: Every answer includes references to source documents
- **Adjustable Settings**: Customize the number of results and relevance threshold

## Settings

Use the settings panel (gear icon) to adjust:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Number of chunks** | How many document sections to retrieve | 5 |
| **Certainty threshold** | Minimum relevance score (0.0 - 1.0) | 0.75 |

> **Tip**: Lower the certainty threshold if you're not getting results, or increase it for more precise matches.

## Example Questions

### Product & Roadmap
- "What is the product roadmap?"
- "Tell me about the MVP phase"
- "What features are planned for Phase 2?"
- "What is Fin Pulse?"

### Technical & Database
- "What databases are we using?"
- "Explain the data architecture"
- "What are the database schemas?"

### Investment & Finance
- "What investment strategies are documented?"
- "Tell me about the investor specialist role"

### Support & Tickets
- "How do we handle support tickets?"
- "What is the ticket workflow?"

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: "What is the Phase 1 MVP timeline?" works better than "timeline"
2. **Use natural language**: Ask questions as you would ask a colleague
3. **Check sources**: Click on source links to see the full context
4. **Adjust settings**: If results aren't relevant, try lowering the certainty threshold

## Understanding Responses

Each response includes:
- **Answer**: AI-generated response based on retrieved content
- **Sources**: List of documents used to generate the answer
  - Title and section
  - Source filename
  - Folder location

Click on any source to view the full content in the side panel.
